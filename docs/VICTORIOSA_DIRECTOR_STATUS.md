## Repository Publication

- Safe publish branch:
  `codex/victoriosa-staging-foundation-publish`
- Remote repository:
  `https://github.com/trabajosrapidosuy-commits/Victoriosa-marketplace`
- GitHub Push Protection rejected the inherited local history because an older
  commit contained a Supabase credential under `credenciales/`.
- Published branch was rebuilt from `origin/main` with the validated safe tree.
- PR `#2`: MERGED into `main`.
- Mitigation PR for the latest guardrail commit: BLOCKED_MISSING_ACCESS. Open
  manually from the published branch.

## Platform Link

- Supabase project `Victoriosa-marketplace` (`ngliugfcwydnfbpalkpb`):
  ACTIVE_HEALTHY through the authenticated MCP connector.
- Supabase staging migrations: foundation, autopilot foundation and admin
  boundary present.
- Vercel project `victoriosa-marketplace`: CREATED_AND_LOCALLY_LINKED.
- Vercel Git repository connection: CONNECTED.
- Vercel branch-scoped Preview variables: CONFIGURED with public URL and anon
  key only.
- Vercel deployed public smoke: PASS.
- Vercel Preview:
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-i9nqyd117-akuma424-projects.vercel.app`
- Vercel Preview status: READY_TARGET_PREVIEW_PROTECTED.
- Preview-only `VICTORIOSA_DEMO_MODE=true`: CONFIGURED.
- Local functional demo: `http://localhost:3101/productos`.
- Production incident: a bare Vercel deploy command unexpectedly created a
  Ready deployment with `target=production` and aliases. No production flag or
  promote command was used. No rollback or alias mutation was executed.
- Deployment URL:
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-ecru.vercel.app`

## Implemented

1. Added public presentation contract that omits internal fields.
2. Added server-side public catalog service over the canonical repository.
3. Migrated `/`, `/productos`, `/productos/[slug]` and `/kits` away from local
   seeds.
4. Removed visitor-facing admin navigation and import links.
5. Removed internal risk, compliance and review labels from public cards and
   detail.
6. Replaced checkout and cart entry surfaces with honest
   `Compra online proximamente` messaging while payments remain disabled.
7. Added professional empty catalog state.
8. Added public storefront safety tests.
9. Redirected legacy `/products`, `/cart`, `/orders/[id]` and `/thank-you`
   surfaces to safe canonical pages.
10. Applied `requireAdmin` to the full `/admin` UI tree before render.

## Staging Smoke

- `npm run rls:smoke`: PASS.
- Public catalog visible rows: ZERO.
- Anonymous draft visibility: ZERO.
- Imported `draft + needs_review` products remain hidden.
- Internal Autopilot tables hidden: PASS.

## Browser Smoke

- Local home title: `Victoriosa Marketplace`.
- Home empty catalog message: visible.
- Catalog empty state: visible.
- Public admin link: absent.
- Internal labels: absent.
- Legacy `/products`, `/cart` and `/thank-you` redirects: PASS.
- Anonymous `/admin/marketplace` redirect to `/`: PASS, no panel leak.
- Screenshot: CHECK_NOT_RUN_COMPLETE, embedded viewport screenshot was not
  required for DOM verification.
- Mobile viewport smoke: CHECK_NOT_RUN, viewport capability documentation was
  not available in the installed browser bundle.

## Checks

- `npm run staging:check`: PASS
- `npm run rls:smoke`: PASS
- `npm run secret:scan`: PASS
- `npm run production:check`: PASS
- `npm run guard:no-production-deploy`: PASS
- `npm run test:rls:static`: PASS, 18 public tables
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS
- `npm run test`: PASS, 26 tests
- `npm run build`: PASS
- `npm run smoke:structure`: PASS
- `git diff --check`: PASS
- `npm run ci`: CHECK_NOT_RUN_COMPLETE, gates executed sequentially to avoid
  the previously observed wrapper hang.

## Preview Smoke

- Explicit Preview deployment: PASS, `target=preview`.
- Protected Preview anonymous boundary: PASS, HTTP `401`.
- Cycle 021 completed: founder-provided Sofia Victoria portrait integrated as
  an original premium Victoriosa hero with natural editorial retouch.
- Sofia Victoria hero Preview: PASS, `target=preview`, `Ready`,
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-3id8vyhgs-akuma424-projects.vercel.app`.
- Cycle 022 authenticated staging smoke: PASS with reversible temporary users.
- Security hotfix: PASS, `victoriosa_profile_role_escalation_guard` applied to
  authorized staging after smoke detected a surviving broad profile update
  privilege. Remote retry confirmed role escalation blocked.
- Google OAuth provider bootstrap: PASS for local and documented Preview
  redirects. Interactive Google identity smoke remains external.
- Public signup: CHECK_NOT_RUN_COMPLETE, Supabase returned email delivery rate
  limit HTTP `429`; no temporary auth residue remained.
- Positive admin browser smoke: CHECK_NOT_RUN_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS.
  One staging admin profile exists, but its credential is not loaded locally.
- Protected Preview route smoke:
  CHECK_NOT_RUN_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS because no project-specific
  automation bypass is available.
- Public deployed smoke: PASS, home and `/productos` render.
- Public deployed API smoke: PASS, `{"products":[]}`.
- Legacy API smoke: PASS, product, order and import handlers remain deprecated.
- Anonymous `/admin/marketplace`: PASS, redirects away from admin.
- Authenticated admin deployed smoke:
  CHECK_NOT_RUN_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS.
- Browser embedded smoke: CHECK_NOT_RUN_BROWSER_HOST_ATTACH_TIMEOUT.
- Local staging RLS smoke: PASS.

## Functional Demo

- Catalog demo notice: PASS.
- Catalog sample cards: PASS.
- Product detail: PASS.
- Add-to-cart control: PASS.
- Persistent local cart route: PASS.
- Manual checkout route: PASS.
- Real payment execution: DISABLED.
- Demo products: explicitly labeled and never persisted as published records.

## Blockers

- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: public signup email confirmation delivery
  validation returned HTTP `429`; retry after provider cooldown.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: interactive Google and positive admin browser
  smoke require controlled identities loaded outside chat.
- `BLOCKED_SUPABASE_ACCESS`: current Sofia Victoria Preview callback and reset
  URLs still need allowlist confirmation.
- Cycle 020 completed: original editorial hero, premium navigation, email auth,
  SSR session refresh, private account pages and safe user preferences.
- Authorized staging `ngliugfcwydnfbpalkpb`: migration
  `victoriosa_email_auth_profiles_settings` applied and listed remotely.
- `npm run ci`: PASS, including 31 tests and build with 46 routes.
- `npm run staging:check` and `npm run rls:smoke`: CHECK_NOT_RUN in the current
  shell because `.env.rls` retains empty staging smoke values.
- Google OAuth bootstrap is configured. The local OAuth credential file remains
  ignored and was not read or committed.
- Explicit Preview deployment: PASS, `target=preview`, `Ready`,
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-ntcbh4o5p-akuma424-projects.vercel.app`.
- Protected Preview anonymous boundary: PASS, HTTP `401`.

- `BLOCKED_MISSING_ACCESS`: the authenticated GitHub account can push the
  branch but cannot create the mitigation PR.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: supplier and payment sandbox credentials
  remain absent.
- `BLOCKED_PRODUCTION_RISK`: an accidental Vercel deployment has
  `target=production`. Alias removal, rollback or deletion requires explicit
  human approval.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: authenticated deployed admin smoke requires
  staging admin credentials loaded through a secure local mechanism.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: protected Preview route smoke requires a
  project-specific Vercel automation bypass loaded securely.
- `BLOCKED_PRODUCTION_RISK`: production remains prohibited until canonical
  orders, fulfillment, compliance and payment sandbox cycles are complete.

## NEXT_CODEX_PROMPT

Repository: `C:\victoriosa-autopilot-admin-control-center`

Branch: `codex/victoriosa-git-upload-repair`

Mode: `VICTORIOSA_MANUAL_VERCEL_SCOPE_AUDIT_PREP`

Objective: prepare a read-only inventory worksheet for every Vercel scope and
project connected to this repository, then record human-verified Production
Branch settings without modifying Vercel, GitHub branches or PR #25.

Rules:

- Keep PR #25 draft.
- Do not merge or retarget.
- Do not create Production deployments.
- Do not modify Vercel or Production environment variables.
- Never print secrets.

Checks:

See `docs/autonomous-cycles/CYCLE_VICTORIOSA_AGENT_SYSTEM_BOOTSTRAP.md`.

Integration preview smoke repeated after confirming the Vercel Production
Branch is expected to remain `production`. Production remains
`NO-GO_PRODUCTION`.

## Integration Preview-Only Smoke Repeat

Date: 2026-06-07

- Initial smoke commit `0513268`: Preview-only deployment created, build
  failed because three Autopilot admin pages contained partial merge
  regressions.
- Corrective commit `ee73eb9`: local build and all required checks passed.
- Vercel result: `PASS` in both observed scopes.
- Deployment classification: `Preview`, `production_environment=false`.
- Production deployment triggered: `NO`.
- PR #25 remains draft and unchanged.

Decision: `GO_INTEGRATION_PREVIEW_ONLY`.
