## Repository Publication

- Safe publish branch:
  `codex/victoriosa-staging-foundation-publish`
- Remote repository:
  `https://github.com/trabajosrapidosuy-commits/Victoriosa-marketplace`
- GitHub Push Protection rejected the inherited local history because an older
  commit contained a Supabase credential under `credenciales/`.
- Published branch was rebuilt from `origin/main` with the validated safe tree.
- PR `#2`: MERGED into `main`.
- Mitigation PR for the latest guardrail commit: BLOCKED_MISSING_ACCESS. Open
  manually from the published branch.

## Platform Link

- Supabase project `Victoriosa-marketplace` (`ngliugfcwydnfbpalkpb`):
  ACTIVE_HEALTHY through the authenticated MCP connector.
- Supabase staging migrations: foundation, autopilot foundation and admin
  boundary present.
- Vercel project `victoriosa-marketplace`: CREATED_AND_LOCALLY_LINKED.
- Vercel Git repository connection: CONNECTED.
- Vercel branch-scoped Preview variables: CONFIGURED with public URL and anon
  key only.
- Vercel deployed public smoke: PASS.
- Vercel Preview:
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-i9nqyd117-akuma424-projects.vercel.app`
- Vercel Preview status: READY_TARGET_PREVIEW_PROTECTED.
- Preview-only `VICTORIOSA_DEMO_MODE=true`: CONFIGURED.
- Local functional demo: `http://localhost:3101/productos`.
- Production incident: a bare Vercel deploy command unexpectedly created a
  Ready deployment with `target=production` and aliases. No production flag or
  promote command was used. No rollback or alias mutation was executed.
- Deployment URL:
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-ecru.vercel.app`

## Implemented

1. Added public presentation contract that omits internal fields.
2. Added server-side public catalog service over the canonical repository.
3. Migrated `/`, `/productos`, `/productos/[slug]` and `/kits` away from local
   seeds.
4. Removed visitor-facing admin navigation and import links.
5. Removed internal risk, compliance and review labels from public cards and
   detail.
6. Replaced checkout and cart entry surfaces with honest
   `Compra online proximamente` messaging while payments remain disabled.
7. Added professional empty catalog state.
8. Added public storefront safety tests.
9. Redirected legacy `/products`, `/cart`, `/orders/[id]` and `/thank-you`
   surfaces to safe canonical pages.
10. Applied `requireAdmin` to the full `/admin` UI tree before render.

## Staging Smoke

- `npm run rls:smoke`: PASS.
- Public catalog visible rows: ZERO.
- Anonymous draft visibility: ZERO.
- Imported `draft + needs_review` products remain hidden.
- Internal Autopilot tables hidden: PASS.

## Browser Smoke

- Local home title: `Victoriosa Marketplace`.
- Home empty catalog message: visible.
- Catalog empty state: visible.
- Public admin link: absent.
- Internal labels: absent.
- Legacy `/products`, `/cart` and `/thank-you` redirects: PASS.
- Anonymous `/admin/marketplace` redirect to `/`: PASS, no panel leak.
- Screenshot: CHECK_NOT_RUN_COMPLETE, embedded viewport screenshot was not
  required for DOM verification.
- Mobile viewport smoke: CHECK_NOT_RUN, viewport capability documentation was
  not available in the installed browser bundle.

## Checks

- `npm run staging:check`: PASS
- `npm run rls:smoke`: PASS
- `npm run secret:scan`: PASS
- `npm run production:check`: PASS
- `npm run guard:no-production-deploy`: PASS
- `npm run test:rls:static`: PASS, 18 public tables
- `npm run lint`: PASS
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS
- `npm run test`: PASS, 26 tests
- `npm run build`: PASS
- `npm run smoke:structure`: PASS
- `git diff --check`: PASS
- `npm run ci`: CHECK_NOT_RUN_COMPLETE, gates executed sequentially to avoid
  the previously observed wrapper hang.

## Preview Smoke

- Explicit Preview deployment: PASS, `target=preview`.
- Protected Preview anonymous boundary: PASS, HTTP `401`.
- Cycle 021 completed: founder-provided Sofia Victoria portrait integrated as
  an original premium Victoriosa hero with natural editorial retouch.
- Sofia Victoria hero Preview: PASS, `target=preview`, `Ready`,
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-3id8vyhgs-akuma424-projects.vercel.app`.
- Cycle 022 authenticated staging smoke: PASS with reversible temporary users.
- Security hotfix: PASS, `victoriosa_profile_role_escalation_guard` applied to
  authorized staging after smoke detected a surviving broad profile update
  privilege. Remote retry confirmed role escalation blocked.
- Google OAuth provider bootstrap: PASS for local and documented Preview
  redirects. Interactive Google identity smoke remains external.
- Public signup: CHECK_NOT_RUN_COMPLETE, Supabase returned email delivery rate
  limit HTTP `429`; no temporary auth residue remained.
- Positive admin browser smoke: CHECK_NOT_RUN_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS.
  One staging admin profile exists, but its credential is not loaded locally.
- Protected Preview route smoke:
  CHECK_NOT_RUN_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS because no project-specific
  automation bypass is available.
- Public deployed smoke: PASS, home and `/productos` render.
- Public deployed API smoke: PASS, `{"products":[]}`.
- Legacy API smoke: PASS, product, order and import handlers remain deprecated.
- Anonymous `/admin/marketplace`: PASS, redirects away from admin.
- Authenticated admin deployed smoke:
  CHECK_NOT_RUN_BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS.
- Browser embedded smoke: CHECK_NOT_RUN_BROWSER_HOST_ATTACH_TIMEOUT.
- Local staging RLS smoke: PASS.

## Functional Demo

- Catalog demo notice: PASS.
- Catalog sample cards: PASS.
- Product detail: PASS.
- Add-to-cart control: PASS.
- Persistent local cart route: PASS.
- Manual checkout route: PASS.
- Real payment execution: DISABLED.
- Demo products: explicitly labeled and never persisted as published records.

## Blockers

- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: public signup email confirmation delivery
  validation returned HTTP `429`; retry after provider cooldown.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: interactive Google and positive admin browser
  smoke require controlled identities loaded outside chat.
- `BLOCKED_SUPABASE_ACCESS`: current Sofia Victoria Preview callback and reset
  URLs still need allowlist confirmation.
- Cycle 020 completed: original editorial hero, premium navigation, email auth,
  SSR session refresh, private account pages and safe user preferences.
- Authorized staging `ngliugfcwydnfbpalkpb`: migration
  `victoriosa_email_auth_profiles_settings` applied and listed remotely.
- `npm run ci`: PASS, including 31 tests and build with 46 routes.
- `npm run staging:check` and `npm run rls:smoke`: CHECK_NOT_RUN in the current
  shell because `.env.rls` retains empty staging smoke values.
- Google OAuth bootstrap is configured. The local OAuth credential file remains
  ignored and was not read or committed.
- Explicit Preview deployment: PASS, `target=preview`, `Ready`,
  `https://victoriosa-marketplace-ntcbh4o5p-akuma424-projects.vercel.app`.
- Protected Preview anonymous boundary: PASS, HTTP `401`.

- `BLOCKED_MISSING_ACCESS`: the authenticated GitHub account can push the
  branch but cannot create the mitigation PR.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: supplier and payment sandbox credentials
  remain absent.
- `BLOCKED_PRODUCTION_RISK`: an accidental Vercel deployment has
  `target=production`. Alias removal, rollback or deletion requires explicit
  human approval.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: authenticated deployed admin smoke requires
  staging admin credentials loaded through a secure local mechanism.
- `BLOCKED_EXTERNAL_CREDENTIALS`: protected Preview route smoke requires a
  project-specific Vercel automation bypass loaded securely.
- `BLOCKED_PRODUCTION_RISK`: production remains prohibited until canonical
  orders, fulfillment, compliance and payment sandbox cycles are complete.

## Next Mode

`VICTORIOSA_STAGING_GOOGLE_OAUTH_AND_ADMIN_POSITIVE_SMOKE`

## NEXT_CODEX_PROMPT

Repo: `C:\victoriosa`

Branch suggested: `codex/victoriosa-email-auth-profiles-settings`

Objective: complete the remaining controlled Google OAuth and positive admin
browser proof without mutating production.

Rules: keep `PRODUCTION_STATUS=NO-GO_PRODUCTION`; do not deploy production; do
not print secrets; do not weaken RLS; do not execute payments; do not buy from
suppliers; do not send emails; do not expose internal costs publicly; preserve
unrelated worktree changes.

Tasks:

1. Add the current Sofia Victoria Preview callback and reset URLs to Supabase.
2. Load the existing staging admin credential outside chat.
3. Run positive admin browser smoke without changing role assignments.
4. Complete one interactive Google login with an approved staging identity.
5. Retry public signup only after the provider email cooldown.
6. Use only `npm run deploy:preview` if a Preview deployment is required.

GO criterion: Google interactive login and positive admin browser smoke pass
with RLS boundaries preserved.

NO-GO criterion: unauthorized Production mutation, secret exposure, payment
execution or RLS weakening.
